title: Writing Short and Clear Text
category: Principles
---

Texts in user interfaces should be short and clear. Short texts save reading time. Clear texts lead to fewer mistakes. Editing methods described below can help with that.

## Use simple constructions 
* Use simple verb forms. Prefer present tense.
* Use simple sentences: one idea per sentence.
* Avoid passive voice.


This way the same meaning can be expressed with less words. Compare:

   _Those resources that are available locally_ → _Local resources_ 

   _Maven has to use_ → _Maven uses_

   _The use of a secure connection is required_ → _Use secure connection_


## Remove or elaborate generic words 
* Words like general, advanced, and options do not add useful information and can be removed with no harm to the meaning: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-general.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-options.png)
*No meaning is lost after removing group headers "General" and "Options".*


* Some generic words cannot be removed. They can appear in actionable elements like buttons, checkboxes or links. Or removing a group header could break a dialog layout. In such cases, use a more informative label instead:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-renamed-link.png)
*The link "Learn more" does not explain what useful information could be there for the user to click it.*


## Remove obvious objects and actions 
* Remove verbs that explain the function of a UI control:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-specify.png)
*Text boxes are made for input — an explicit instruction "specify" duplicates the meaning expressed by the text field. Additional information can be given under the field — see [Context help]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/context_help).* 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-prefer.png) *A selected radio button means its option is "preferred".* | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-allow.png) *A checked checkbox means its feature is "allowed".*  


* Remove words with meaning that is already expressed in the same label:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-contents.png) *The clipboard’s purpose is to keep information so the infinitive "to keep" is implying the obvious and can be removed.*|![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-functionality.png) *The word “functionality” is already implied by "Drag’n’Drop" and can be removed.*  


## Do not address the user
A user interface is for a person who uses it. Addressing this person is unnecessary because they by default perceive the text they see as for them:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/addressing1.png)


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/addressing2.png)
*The whole phrase after the comma is not needed because its meaning is already expressed by the verb "configure".*


## Remove duplicates
* If the repeating word appears in element labels, move it to the beginning. Finding a setting becomes faster as you scan only meaningful words:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/duplicates.png)


* Remove duplicates in meaning:

Before | After |
--- | --- | ---
Help improve IntelliJ IDEA by sending anonymous usage statistics to JetBrains s.r.o. | Help improve IntelliJ IDEA | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The purpose of the header is to attract attention. The shorter and clearer header does that better.*
if you want to help make IntelliJ IDEA better | Allow sending anonymous usage statistics to JetBrains s.r.o. | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*“Help make IntelliJ IDEA better” is already expressed in the message header. The body text now explains how the user can do that.*
more... | Terms and conditions | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The link more... does not tell what is behind it — unclear for the user why to click it.*

Removed |
--- | ---
click I agree | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The verb "click" is obvious from context: you cannot do much with a link other than click.*
click... I don’t agree otherwise | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The link "I don’t agree" duplicates the notification “Close” button which appears on hover.*
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/notificationInfo.png) | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The icon is not needed because the message is purely informative, not an error or a warning. Texts are information by default, there is no need to specify that meaning explicitly.*


## Translate from tech to human
When you make a feature, you know how it works from the inside and can describe it from the implementation point of view: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/indent-options-before.png)


A person not familiar with implementation details won’t know what the Automatic indent options detector is, why file’s indent options have been overwritten and what indent size=2 means. Translated to the “human” language, the message reads: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/indent-options-after.png)
 
 
Always write UI text from a user’s perspective. Avoid technical terms, jargon and descriptions of inner logic that a user might not know.

 
## Write for first-time users
After writing a UI text, imagine seeing it for the first time and try to understand what might be unclear or confusing. Then correct if necessary.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-file-colors-before.png)
*For a first-time user, Enable File Colors enables or disables the other two options (but it does not).*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-file-colors-after.png)
*Rewritten: now all options are equal.*


More examples:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-auto-insert.png) *Before: The title can be read as “Auto-insert when only one checkbox is on” making you ask how does it work when both checkboxes are on. After: Replacing choice with completion option makes the title unambiguous.*|![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-smart-keys.png)*Before: What do smart Home and End keys do? What do they do if they are not smart? After: Added text explains what the options do so that the reader can make an informed choice.*


### Examples
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/project-structure.png)

Before | After |
--- | --- | ---
Project name, Project SDK, Project language level | Name, SDK, Language level | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*"Project" can be left only for the first field. All others will be understood as project settings because they appear in the same group of UI elements.*
This path is used to store | This path stores | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*Simple verb form*
store all project compilation results | stores project compilation output |![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*“all” is extra because it is implied by default. “results” is another word for “output” — having different words for the same meaning complicates understanding.*
A directory corresponding to each module is created under this path. This directory contains two subdirectories... | It has a separate directory for each module, with the Production and Test subdirectories. | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*“is created” is not relevant to the meaning of this phrase. “two” is obvious from context: you see that there are two subdirectories because only two are named.*

Moved |
--- | ---
This [field name] is default for all project modules. A module specific [field name] can be configured for each of the modules is required. | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*This phrase is repeated for all fields. Can be shown only once at the bottom of the dialog.*



![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/offline-mode.png)

Before | After |
--- | --- | ---
visits the remote repositories and checks for updates | checks remote repositories for updates | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*“Checks” already includes the meaning of “visits”.*
When you switch to offline mode | In the offline mode | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The action “switched” is not relevant for the meaning of this phrase. Also, an unnecessary reference to the user — “you”.*
Maven has to use | Maven uses |![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*Not relevant that a technology must do something, enough to say it just works this way.*
those resources that are available locally | local resources |
reports about the problems if something is missing | reports if something is missing |

Removed |
--- | ---
The offline mode is helpful when you need to work offline | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*The phrase does not explain when the offline mode is helpful. It should either be elaborated or removed.*
or when your network connection is slow | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/h.png)*Only one of possible uses for the offline mode and an obvious one. Can be removed for a more concise text.*
