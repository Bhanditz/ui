## Title

### Use for
* Actions: buttons, menus, and links that invoke an action
* Headers in tables, dialogs, message boxes, notifications and tooltips
* Labels of UI elements groups 

<aside class="note sideblock _visible">The current Windows guidelines use sentence capitalization for actions. Some Microsoft products still title-capitalize actions according to the previous guidelines. Mac OS X also title-capitalizes actions. Since IntelliJ IDEs are cross-platform, we use title capitalization as well.</aside>



### Rules
* Always capitalize the first and the last words.

* Capitalize the words in-between except:

    * articles: _a, an, the_,
    * coordinating conjunctions: *and, or, but*,
    * prepositions of four and less letters which are not a part of a phrasal verb: *in, with*.

* In hyphenated phrases, capitalize all nouns, adjectives and adverbs: *Auto-Indent, Command-Line Launcher*.
Do not capitalize articles, prepositions and conjunctions: *Side-by-Side, Drag-and-Drop*.


### Examples
_Compare With…_ — the short preposition with is capitalized because it is the last word.

*Compare with Latest Repository Version* — with is not capitalized when in the middle.

*Check Out from Version Control* — *out* is a part of the phrasal verb *check out* and is capitalized.




## Sentence

### Use for
* Labels for UI controls: text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, comboboxes, etc.
* Items in comboboxes, lists, trees and tables
* Body text in error messages, tooltips, notifications, status descriptions and any kind of instructions (but title-capitalize their headers)

### Rules
Capitalize the first word in a sentence, proper nouns and adjectives, and abbreviations.

### Examples
*Control+Shift+F* — keyboard button names are considered proper nouns.

*Accept the terms of the License Agreement* — License Agreement is a proper noun.

*Side-by-side layout* — only the first word of a hyphenated phase is capitalized.
