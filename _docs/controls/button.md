Button initiate an immediate action.
<br/> ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/images/button/button.png)



Use button to initiate an immediate action.
But use a link if:
* The command leads to another window (except navigation buttons Back and Next).
* The command is embedded in a body of text.
* The command leads to reference material (except Help button).
* The command leads to to a web page.


## Guidelines
* If the same command button appears in more than one window, use the same label text.
* Do not use the buttons to change status as "on/off". Instead, use the toggle, radio buttons, or checkboxes.
* For each button in group of buttons use the same width.
* When another control interoperates with a command button show the relationship by placing the command button in one of three places:
    * To the right of and top-aligned with the other control.
    * Below and left-aligned with the other control.
    * Vertically centered between controls that interoperate (such as Add and Remove buttons between two interoperating list boxes).

* Labels
    * Indicate a command that needs additional information (including confirmation) by adding an ellipsis at the end of the button label. Not all button whose implicit verb is to "show another window" take an ellipsis. Ellipsis needed only if additional information is required to perform the action.
    * The label contains no more than four words.
    * Label is written with a capital letter and should explicitly report what will happen if you click on button.
    * Learn recommendations for [UI text]( {{ site.baseurl }}/principles/UI_text/).
