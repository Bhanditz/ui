# IntelliJ IDEA Guidelines
This is a repository for IntelliJ IDEA user interface guidelines.

## Working With the Site Locally
To check out and run a local copy of the site follow the steps described below.

### Pre-requirements
1. This site requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Follow the instruction to install
 Jekyll on your machine:
 * [Mac OS](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/install-jekyll-on-os-x/)
 * [Windows](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/install-jekyll-on-windows/)

    ```

### Checking Out Site Repository

```
git clone git@github.com:JetBrains/ui.git
```

### Building and Previewing
To start the web-server run:
```
cd test_idea_guide/
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Jekyll will build the site and start a web server, which can be viewed in your browser at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

### Editing
To edit the guidelines open it in IDE. Guidelines pages are stored in _docs folder and are organised by categories. Pages are in Markdown format. See quick primer on writing in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

* To edit a page open the required .md file and modify it. Enable preview mode for markdown files on the right top corner:
