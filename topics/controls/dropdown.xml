A drop-down list is a list of predefined values. Custom values are not supported.
![Drop-down example](dropdown_example.png)

Use drop-down list if:

* The possible choices are constrained.
* The number of choices is between 3 and 15. If less than 3 use [radio button](radiobutton.xml), if more than 15 use [combo box](combobox.xml), [input field](input_field), [slider](slider) or [list box](list_box).
* The elements are **things** (nouns) or **states** (adjectives). If you need to provide a menu of commands (verbs), use an [action menu](action_menu) instead.
* There are other drop-down lists on the window (for consistency).
* There is not enough space for bigger controls (e.g. for slider).

## Guidelines

The basic principles that should be followed when using drop-down:

* The drop-down items should be nouns or adjectives (not verbs).
* Number of elements is between 3 and 15.
* Clicking anywhere in drop-down should open its drop-down list.
* Drop-down width:
    * Choose a width appropriate for the longest data, but not less than the minimum for a particular theme (see below).
    * Ensure that drop-downs have the same width if there are several drop-downs in a column.

* Drop-down list length: limit list length only if there is not enough space to show the full list, try to eliminate unnecessary vertical scrolling.
* Use title-style capitalization for the elements in a drop-down list.
* Sort list items in a logical order:
    * group related options,
    * place most common options first or use alphabetical order (always if number of items is more than 8).
* Do not assign special meanings to specific numeric or string values (e.g. blank string). Use meta-options in pointy brackets instead.

* If possible use previews in the list items:

* Label:
    * Write label as word or sentence. In first case end label with a colon, in second use no ending punctuation:

    * Use sentence-style capitalization.

## Mac OS default
In Mac OS default theme drop-down has a double-arrow indicator and displays a checkmark to the left of the currently selected value when open.

When drop-down is opened, selected value should stay at the same position.
By default show the whole drop-down list. If there is not enough space, then add the arrow icon at the bottom of the list and scroll through the list by hovering over it:

## IntelliJ, Darcula
Sizing and spacing should be the same for IntelliJ as for Darcula.
